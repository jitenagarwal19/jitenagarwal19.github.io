&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017&lt;/strong&gt; is here and lots of great things are about to happen this year in my life and in the world. I will be shifting to a &lt;strong&gt;new place&lt;/strong&gt;, I will turn &lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt;, I will be completing &lt;strong&gt;2 years of my professional career&lt;/strong&gt; and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016 was a great year for me it raised the bars high for 2017 and I am hoping this will be the trend for the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year my main focus will be to an amazing programmer, I still am a decent programmer and I tried different learning techniques and methods in 2016, this year I am hoping to take it off the charts, I am yet to create list of actionable items that will take me to the fulfillment of this goal. Another thing that has caught my interest in 2016 was reading books, I can’t express in words what benefits I have gained from reading books. My area of interest in book reading will be more in philosophy and economics and fiction while I am traveling or when I want to sleep better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also here are few objectives that I will achieve in 2017 and this list will expand for at least 3 months (order is irrelevant)-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-weekend-fasting&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Weekend Fasting&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few things that changed my life in 2016 was becoming fit and active, I think I was in my &lt;strong&gt;fittest version&lt;/strong&gt; in 2016. This year I want to take it to a next level and start implementing no carbs weekend, I am hoping to start this small like 1 weekend in one month, then twice and so on. Benefits of this -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal Cleansing of body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During weekends I generally stay at home doing my things, which sometimes leads to the unwanted stuffing of calories, this &lt;strong&gt;discipline&lt;/strong&gt; will put a check on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will compliment in my adverse time.(&lt;strong&gt;You don’t need unhealthy food to rejuvenate or uplift your mood&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will make me more tolerant to pain and hunger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-cross-borders-of-india&#34;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Cross Borders of India&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah!! 2016 was full of traveling &lt;strong&gt;Leh&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Kerala&lt;/strong&gt;, so many treks and I really enjoyed all of the trips. My bonding with friends, family and myself increased after these trips and I have so many &lt;strong&gt;happy memories to cherish&lt;/strong&gt;. I want to take this traveling spirit at a next step and put my foot out of India. It’s not like I hate India, I love it but taking an international trip was on my checklist for a long time and I intend to check it off this year. Following are the destinations in my head, please suggest more in comments
* Dubai
* Hong Kong
* Jordan
* Thailand or Bangkok :p
* Maybe some parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-a-month-without-whatsapp-leaving-all-the-groups&#34;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;A Month Without Whatsapp &amp;amp; Leaving all the Groups&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t hate WhatsApp, &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome feat of engineering&lt;/strong&gt;, but sometimes it makes me wonder how much time I and people surrounding me waste on WhatsApp. I ditched facebook in 2016 and my life is pretty much unaffected I am hoping WhatsApp is overrated too and I can easily get rid of it. &lt;strong&gt;It just surrounding pressure that forces you to use Whatsapp&lt;/strong&gt;, I am not able to get rid of the WhatsApp now because I live in a no network zone and WhatsApp is an alternative for calling and communicating. Once I move out of this zone I will definitely ditch Whatsapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-active-blogging&#34;&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Active blogging&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always &lt;strong&gt;bad at communicating my ideas to the world&lt;/strong&gt; because I feel that my linguistic part of the brain is weak and I need to make it stronger. &lt;strong&gt;Active blogging will allow me to force my ideas and thoughts out of my head and put it in words&lt;/strong&gt;. What I am planning to do is put out &lt;strong&gt;at least two blogs per week&lt;/strong&gt; (long or short doesn’t matter) and during my free space of time, I will keep thinking of a good idea or topic for the blog which I will note it down. Blogging so far feels great it’s like open sourcing your thoughts to the world, at this point in time, I know that very few people read my blogs and I will try to increase my audience too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-progressive-web-app-of-my-website&#34;&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Progressive Web App of My Website&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put out &lt;a href=&#34;jitenagarwal.com&#34;&gt;jitenagarwal.com&lt;/a&gt; during fall of 2016, and it started with the idea of getting a &lt;strong&gt;better job&lt;/strong&gt; and as a &lt;strong&gt;medium to showcase my work&lt;/strong&gt;, but now I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop here. More I think about how I can use my website more Ideas pop in my mind and more effort that will require. Right now this website is just static(which was a good start). But I am hoping to move out of that and make it like an application and implement following things -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo sharing Page(Instagram is for Millennials and Muggles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track my habits and create charts of trends using D3.js (see point 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging the places(restaurants, hotels any other tourist site) I have been&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing technical and project experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing all other stuff (books, podcasts, movies, things that I have bought)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-scheduling&#34;&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Scheduling&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took &lt;strong&gt;good control of my time&lt;/strong&gt; in 2016 as compared to my previous years but when I listen to awesome people on the planet talking about how much valuable time is and it makes me feel like a jerk, throwing my time here and there. Basically, I am planning, Scheduling on Weekly and Monthly basis which will allow me to manage my time resource wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-logging-everything-and-taking-notes&#34;&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Logging Everything and Taking Notes&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you &lt;strong&gt;workout intensely&lt;/strong&gt; you understand the power of logs. Without logging your workout, everything goes for a toss and you cannot &lt;strong&gt;track your progress and areas of improvement&lt;/strong&gt;. And &lt;strong&gt;things which cannot be measured cannot be improved&lt;/strong&gt;. So, I thought why not apply the logging framework for everything in my life I am working on &lt;strong&gt;creating an application&lt;/strong&gt; for it and I will track following things on it -
* Workout logs (obviously)
* Programming languages I worked on every day
* My Diet habits(avoiding sugar, fried and other Junk)
* Reading Habit
* And Other habits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-stop-giving-free-advice&#34;&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;Stop giving Free Advice&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave lots of free advice to people in 2016 only with good intentions and to help them in any way I can. But giving free advice kind of sets a &lt;strong&gt;tiny bit of expectations&lt;/strong&gt; in my head of them following my advice and you know how dangerous is expecting from other people(&lt;strong&gt;MOSTLY DISAPPOINTMENT&lt;/strong&gt;). So to save myself from Disappointment I will just put out my thoughts and help on my blog and will &lt;strong&gt;stop giving free advice&lt;/strong&gt; unless anyone asks for it. Quote from Joker comes to my mind which fits perfectly here - &lt;strong&gt;IF YOU ARE GOOD AT SOMETHING NEVER DO IT FOR FREE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-5-minutes-gratitude-journal&#34;&gt;9. &lt;strong&gt;5 Minutes gratitude journal&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explored a lot of ways of journaling which will fit my lifestyle and I have finally settled on this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-follow-stoicism-religiously&#34;&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;Follow Stoicism Religiously&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you dont know what Stoicism here is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stoicism&#34;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. I have come to understanding that life is going to be &lt;strong&gt;tough &amp;amp; painful&lt;/strong&gt;. Subsidising these painful moments and hardships by partying and doing other muggle thing is really not my style. I was looking for a certain philosophy to deal with pain and hardships which lead me to &lt;strong&gt;Stoicism&lt;/strong&gt;. I am currently reading all the literature and books around Stoicism to figure out how to adopt a Stoic Life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not my exhaustive list of resolutions but I will keep updating also I am asking my friends and family about one resolution that they would like to add on my list, which will make me reflect more on myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any thoughts and comments to share please share them I would love to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-hope-you-too-have-an-amazing-2017&#34;&gt;I HOPE YOU TOO HAVE AN AMAZING 2017.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;peace&#34;&gt;PEACE.&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Best Gift Parents can Give to their Children</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt; - I am no parenting expert, just putting out my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--People are generally not experienced in parenting, but they get over time. And parenting according me is the most difficult and 
challenging task. One of the reason why I think parenting is difficult because it involves shaping a character of individual who
will go out in the society and it is safe to say that Osama Bin Laden and Bill Gates are ouput of parenting. 
So parenting is like passing on your learnings about the world to your offsprings. I feel this task involves great amount of responsibility.

I was lucky to have great Parents, despite having poor schooling experience because we lived in very remote Indian village having no English Medium School in the radius of 20kms I flourished very well.
The reason why I consider my parents to be great because they __trusted me__, what I mean by that is I had full ownership of my life and my parents were always there behind my back.
This allowed me to take lots of bad decisions and learned from them and I feel totally responsible for what I am right now.
The decisions can be minor or major like which school I will go to, should I opt engineering or medical or something else, should I go to kota.
I am not implying that my parents let me suffer by my bad decisions, no that is not the case, they knew when situations were going in the wrong directions and took control immediately.

Giving fi--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parenting is hard and for majority of parents it is their first time. So we all know what it is like to do a
difficult task with inexperience. Apart from cleaning shit and pee stuff, the part where it really gets difficult is when
you are supposed to impart your values to your offspring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think when you have kids you get some kind of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Power&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; you get. Power of releasing a product in the society who might become president or a criminal one day.
&lt;strong&gt;So with great power comes great responsiblity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to have great parents. Now that I am an adult and kind of on my own when I looked back I realized what were the key great things that every parent should consider. While I am not saying I am very successful individual but I think
my parents were very successful parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there might be great researches out there which might make this post obvious and noob, these are my thoughts and what I learned from my parents. I want to point out some great parenting
style that my parents adopted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating an Environment of Free Will&lt;/strong&gt;- What I mean by that is as a kid we barely make decisions, partly because we are too naive at that time and also our parents are sometimes too protective but I think allowing me to make many crucial decisions of my life with their support was the best thing my parents did to me. It has made me more responsible and less-blaming-others human being which I think is great skill to have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encouraging Honesty&lt;/strong&gt; - I know it is difficult to explain to a 10-year old what is honesty. But I think the reason kids lie most is because parents scare the shit out of them for small mistakes, which causes the child to lie. I think instead of scolding a child about his/her mistakes parents should try to make sure that he/she admits mistake and learns from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Comparing with Sharmaji&amp;rsquo;s Child&lt;/strong&gt; - I hate when any parent compares his/her child with other child(ren). I just don&amp;rsquo;t understand how comparing will ever help in your child&amp;rsquo;s development. Please provide some actionable and constructive feedback if you want your child&amp;rsquo;s development and understand that every child is unique(&lt;strong&gt;Yes for the millionth time!&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Putting in Hostel before Secondary Education&lt;/strong&gt; - I can&amp;rsquo;t thank my parents enough for letting me stay with them till my 10th(After that I had no choice) despite living in a village. How will you ever impart your knowledge and values if you put your son/daughter in a hostel at such an early stage? Its like putting a kid in a factory(Sorry but True). You have kids because you want to leave a legacy behind you and putting them in hostels never help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Believing and Trusting Kids&lt;/strong&gt; - I think parents should be confident that thier offsprings are capable of doing things own their own and not worrying &amp;amp; being paranoid about them all the time.It is very important for a healthy &lt;strong&gt;parent-child&lt;/strong&gt; relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spending Time With Kids&lt;/strong&gt; - I was lucky to born in prosperous business family. And we always had time for &lt;strong&gt;vacations&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;daily-fun-family-time&lt;/strong&gt;(like playing sports, watching movies together etc etc). I have good amount of fun memories with my parents which I am really happy about and would cherish them lifelong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freedom to Try&lt;/strong&gt; - My parents bought Computer when I was 10 year old doofus and having computer at that time was kind of a big thing. It is safe to say I was introduced with &lt;strong&gt;love of my life&lt;/strong&gt;. But at the same time I attended karate classes, music classes and many other classes, Eventually ended up with marrying computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-am-sure-there-are-many-other-great-things-that-my-parents-did-which-made-me-a-better-person-and-i-will-surely-update-them-if-i-could-recall-them-please-share-your-thoughts-and-views-on-the-same&#34;&gt;I am sure there are many other great things that my parents did which made me a better person and I will surely update them if I could recall them, please share your thoughts and views on the same.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;till-then-peace&#34;&gt;Till then Peace&lt;/h3&gt;
