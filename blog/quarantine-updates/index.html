              <p>The whole world is gripped by the fear of the Corona Virus. This virus is super-contagious and has symptoms ranging from mild-flu to dangerous life-threatening respiratory disease.  As of writing this memoir 25th March 2020, no cure and vaccine has been discovered yet. Humanity&rsquo;s best shot to contain the virus is to self-isolate and prevent the spreading of the virus.
Many developed countries like Italy, Spain, Germany and even The US of America are shitting their pants to stop the spread of this virus. The fear of what havoc this virus will bring to India are Un-Imaginable. India is a country where rumors and false-beliefs take front-seat and facts are often thrown out of the window. Nevertheless, there is still hope for India as we have not seen wide-spread of the virus and India is still in the early stages of stage-3 i.e. social-transmission.</p>
<p>These times are scary albeit exciting of what future holds for us. Times like these are also a true test of humanity&rsquo;s advancement and how we as species overcome this challenge. Since I am living this time I thought I should have a formal record of emotional coaster that I am going through.</p>
<p>So here we go -</p>
<h2 id="sunday-march-22-2020---here-comes-the-janta-curfew">Sunday, March 22, 2020 - Here Comes the Janta Curfew</h2>
<p>Modiji announced yesterday that nation will have to observe Janta Curfew on this day which basically means a trial nationwide-lockdown for 1 day. He also asked us to come out of our house and clap to show gratitude for the hospital workers and people who will still have to work outside despite the corona in ether.</p>
<p>On this day, I woke up with a scary feeling of Corona like symptoms which includes - mild-fever, sore-throat, and slightly runny nose. I quickly informed my folks to maintain distance from me and declared myself in self-isolation for the coming days until symptoms subside. I am not new to this self-isolation thing as I have been to Vipassana twice which is much more extreme than this.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5MnYyfPLfGGXe/giphy.gif" alt="Corona Corona Corona "></p>
<p>My parents and brother were quite supportive of this and took the self-isolation seriously helping me with my food and water at my room&rsquo;s doorstep.
I know I was over-reacting a bit as there were no cases in our area and I had no travel history as well. But can blame me for this over-reaction and it&rsquo;s good to err on panic and precaution than being chill during times like these.</p>
<p>I spend the day mostly sleeping and recovering while popping some paracetamol along the way. At around 5 pm or I think 4:55 pm I was woken up to the sound of steel-plates banging. Almost, the entire nation was out expressing their gratitude to the front-line warriors of Corona-war. It was kind of epic to see a country that is easily divided by silly religious issues coming together to pay their respect.
Obviously, there were some stupids who came out on roads and started rallying on the streets while banging on the steel-plate.
Stupid INDIANS!!</p>
<p><img src="https://jitenagarwal.com/images/journaling-corona-lockdown/curfew.jpeg" alt="Get Ready for lockdown"></p>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<h2 id="monday---23rd-march-2020----ok-we-are-scared-now">Monday - 23rd March 2020  - Ok We are Scared now.</h2>
<p>Up until yesterday Indians were not taking Corona seriously they like the rest of the world felt that could not be brought down by this Corona thing.  But the Janta Curfew and continuous government intervention about the seriousness issue made everyone scared and alarmed about the situation. Suddenly, in my town, everyone was moving around with masks on.</p>
<p>Stock markets were seeing new lows every day.
Quite interestingly, times like these makes you realize how we always value thing which is not so important. It took us quite a lot of self-introspection to finally say - FUCK ECONOMY. We will bring the economy back if we survive.</p>
<p>Streaming services were throttling the video-quality to non-HD quality - Crazy Times. People were talking to their loved ones over the video-calls which were now quite stable and easily accessible via WhatsApp in India as-well.
On the other end, I was still feeling not so great and not so terrible. Still confused do I even have coronavirus? Better to self-isolate me for a few more days.</p>
<h2 id="tuesday-24th-march-2020---self-isolation---day-33333-oops-its-3rd-day">Tuesday 24th March 2020 - Self-isolation - Day 33333 (Oops it&rsquo;s 3rd day)</h2>
<p>Self-isolation can get crazy. At least I got some work done today and learned a few things about my new eCommerce website and was productive for about 3 hours.
Who cares about being productive if you don&rsquo;t know if you will survive this or not. But then I remembered about the book written by a psychologist (Victor Frankl) written in the German Gas-Chamber and how he came up with a new school of living the life - Logotherapy. Logotherapy is all about finding a good reason to live life and the body will find a way to make it happen. For me, the reason I wanted to survive because I am yet to find that reason out. And, I won&rsquo;t stop until I find the reason that will springboard me out of bed every day without an alarm.</p>
<p>I was feeling significantly better today the fever didn&rsquo;t come back no sore-throat or runny nose. But I wanted to self-isolate for a few more days just to be sure.</p>
<p>The day was concluded by Narendra Modi&rsquo;s 30 minutes from 8pm in which he instructed the nation to go for a nation-wide lockdown for the next 3 weeks starting tomorrow. Let me repeat THREE-FUCKING-WEEKS. These 3 weeks can change everything for these 1.3 billion people. However, this also brings difficult times for people who don&rsquo;t have savings and rely on everyday-wages. These 3 weeks would be the most challenging for them. The rest of us can pass our time on social-media, binge-eating/watching.
I think this will be test of my self-control and meditation of 2 years how I pass my 3 weeks. If history is any indication I usually waste it being super-unproductive in times like these.
Guess what 3 weeks is also a long enough time to make or break any new habit. Indians, if you have been slacking on new year&rsquo;s resolution now is the time to kick it off again. If your resolution was to travel more and meet new people, I think you are fucked.
I have a couple of projects planned for me but nothing concrete yet. I plan tomorrow for the next 3 weeks. See what I did there.</p>
<p><img src="https://jitenagarwal.com/images/journaling-corona-lockdown/lockdown.jpg" alt="Get Ready for lockdown"></p>
<h2 id="wednesday---25th-march-2020">Wednesday - 25th March 2020</h2>
<p>The 3 weeks war is on. War with boredom and all the free time. A war over the feeling of not killing your fellow inmates in the coming 3 weeks. A war to not waste and come out as a slightly better person rather wasting whole time on heedless and content consumption. Ah, man! I can tell you it&rsquo;s hard. For some weird reason, this reminds me of my Kota days when we naive kids used to work even harder when everyone was enjoying/wasting their time on heedless entertainment.
One thing I suck at despite all the meditation is work without a deadline or external motivation. I think this time will be a true test of time.</p>
<p>I woke up feeling slightly grumpy today definitely because of all the last night&rsquo;s media consumption till 2 am. I felt like shit and missed my meditation again.</p>
<p>I fed myself and without giving anything second thought I went to sleep and woke up at 12:30 pm. That was some guilty-pleasure sleep. After waking I realized I was feeling awesome all the symptoms were gone and I felt quite good actually.
I got on with some work and then enjoyed the rest of the day feeling good and promising myself I will work on schedule from tomorrow and not waste my time.
Let&rsquo;s pen down a loose schedule and we will see how that goes.</p>
<p><img src="https://jitenagarwal.com/images/journaling-corona-lockdown/test.jpg" alt="Let&rsquo;s get ready for coming 3 weeks"></p>
<h2 id="thursday---26th-march-2020---trip-to-no-mans-land">Thursday - 26th March 2020 - Trip to No Man&rsquo;s Land</h2>
<p>Today, I woke up feeling a lot better. I started my day by helping mom in her household chores. Everybody in India and now involved in household activities, Indian Uncles more so are being spotted cleaning utensils and trying their luck in Kitchen. I will tell you the kids and Indian Uncles will have deep psychological effects after this lockdown. Both of these groups have do not like to sit idle in the house. They just don&rsquo;t know how to pass their time in their houses.</p>
<p><img src="https://jitenagarwal.com/images/journaling-corona-lockdown/dad-nothing.png" alt="Teaching dad how to do nothing">
We programmers have no problem in getting used to this isolation thing, we thrive in environments like these. The environment in which people don&rsquo;t have to interact with each other. Feed us and leave us alone, that&rsquo;s all we want.</p>
<p>I tried to stick with my schedule until my younger sibling was craving for his musical instrument which was lying 100kms from where we were isolating ourselves. Somehow he convinced everyone that it was important for us to make a trip in this crazy like curfew-situation to fetch his stupid keyboard.
Cut to 10 minutes I found myself sitting in the car with him heading to get the &ldquo;piano&rdquo;. On our way we were stopped at few checkpoints, cops wanted to know why we were out and where we heading. Lucky for us we have a shop which comes under &ldquo;essential&rdquo; so our vehicle has special privileges.
The trip itself was quite eerily. The roads were empty, birds and dogs were roaming on the road like it was nobody&rsquo;s business. Roadside greenery looked much greener and all the shops were locked. I am sure it would have been more spooky if we were to pass any city center but thankfully we managed to reach our destination staying on highways.</p>
<p><img src="https://jitenagarwal.com/images/journaling-corona-lockdown/empty-roads.jpg" alt="Empty highways"></p>
<p>We are here now and I am writing this after cleaning the house as my brother left it as a mess when he hurriedly left suspecting a positive case in the neighborhood. The cleaning experience was calming, taking my mind off the corona thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today.</p>
