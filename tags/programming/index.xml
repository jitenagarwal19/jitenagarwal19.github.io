      <description>This post is the first of many posts to follow describing my journey from a programmer to a businessman. I have been a programmer for 10 years now, and recently I decided to join my family&#39;s business full-time. I saw that transition coming at some point and I always envisioned myself how I will handle this transition.

      <description>I started learning javascript as a part of my 2016 new yearâ€™s resolution and that was one of the best decision I made in 2016. Since then I cannot stop thinking about Javascript. I am doing JS in office and home. I am overwhelmed by how a language built in 2 weeks took such an important place in the programming world.
Before embarking on learning something new(framework or language), I always like to read history about it, and know what was the reason it came into existence, what problem did it solved and read about people who built them.</description>
