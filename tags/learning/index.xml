      <description>It was 26th march 2018 around 11 am I was resting in zostel Kathmandu&amp;rsquo;s terrace. I was recollecting my thoughts on what has happened to me for the past 11 days. My mind was uncomfortably quiet, I was trying to distract it by various thoughts but again it would settle to my body sensations, I could hear the tiniest sound my body was making. It was feeling awkward to be back in the real world — a world full of noises, distractions, hate, and love.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard about Vipassana and want to up your meditation game. You should check it out (Official website)
It is a meditation technique originated in India and was rediscovered by Lord Buddha. You learn how to maintain a balanced and calm mind by observing your bodily sensations.
Vipassana so to speak is not everyone&amp;rsquo;s cup of tea. It&amp;rsquo;s quite intense and not one of those fantasized meditation retreat camps where everyone seems to be in zen mode.</description>

      <description>I was planning to learn UX design for such a long time and finally here is my first UX design project: Lakshya, an app which allows an user to manage their time easily by creating your goals and breaking them down into small tasks. UX design always interested me and being a front-end developer I think UX design skill will definitely come in handy.
I am really thankful for the Springboard for their wonderful course which has amazing curricullum and a very supportive mentorship programme.</description>

      <title>My Journey With Javascript So Far</title>

      <description>I started learning javascript as a part of my 2016 new year’s resolution and that was one of the best decision I made in 2016. Since then I cannot stop thinking about Javascript. I am doing JS in office and home. I am overwhelmed by how a language built in 2 weeks took such an important place in the programming world.
Before embarking on learning something new(framework or language), I always like to read history about it, and know what was the reason it came into existence, what problem did it solved and read about people who built them.</description>
