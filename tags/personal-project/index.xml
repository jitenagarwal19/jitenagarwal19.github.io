      <description>I was planning to learn UX design for such a long time and finally here is my first UX design project: Lakshya, an app which allows an user to manage their time easily by creating your goals and breaking them down into small tasks. UX design always interested me and being a front-end developer I think UX design skill will definitely come in handy.
I am really thankful for the Springboard for their wonderful course which has amazing curricullum and a very supportive mentorship programme.</description>
