      <description>Perception is how we understand things after knowing about the situation/incident/event. Perception is basically the output of your thought process after analyzing the input which here is information about any event.
When I say event it can be any event -
 Person cutting you off in the traffic Osama bin laden killing people Someone having a baby You getting a promotion  Basically, anything which increases the entropy of universe can be called an event.</description>

      <description>Few days back I indulged myself in teaching basic mathematics to a 10-year old kid. While teaching him I realised that how quickly he was grasping stuff compared to how difficult that was for me. This incident led me realize that I was always a dumb kid, it always took me time to figure out stuff.
While I am not at peak of my career, but reaching where I am now for a dumb kid like me is a wonder.</description>

      <description>I have reached in my mid-20s and i am mostly surrounded by a lot of single girls and guys of same age. This age is perfect according to them for a wedding according to Indian parents. It’s like at this point of time parents feel like they have lost a sense of direction in life and have become unemploymed from the parenting job. It does not matter if the kid wants to get married or not all they want is some fun activity which will keep them busy for the next 1 year.</description>
